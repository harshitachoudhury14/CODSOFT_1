**This a number game.
Here is a description for the Java program that implements a number guessing game with score tracking and multiple rounds:

This Java program is a simple number guessing game that allows the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range which is (1-100) . The game provides feedback on whether the user's guess is correct, too high, or too low, and repeats until the user guesses the correct number.

The program includes additional features such as limiting the number of attempts the user has to guess the number, adding the option for multiple rounds, and displaying the user's score based on the number of rounds won.

The user's score is displayed as "games won out of games played" to give a clear indication of their performance. The program also includes input validation to ensure that the user's guess is within the specified range and that the number of attempts is within the allowed limit.

Overall, this program is a fun and engaging way to practice programming skills and improve problem-solving abilities. It is suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
